HeavenAndHell.fuse :tada:
===========

Based on '_[Heaven and Hell](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wsKXDV)_' by [adurdin](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/adurdin) and ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

The motif of the angel and devil was processed here in a shader.
An elaborate fun shader with an anniversary, the fiftieth shader in our github ( Milestone: "fifty toys of shader" ).
In the fuse, the camera pan in the X direction, which has already been prepared in the shader, has been added as a parameter. In the original there is a blue discoloration of the figure's upper body. This has been "adapted". There is also the option of changing the terrain by adding textures. Image1 is intended for the "happy" terrain and Image2 for the "evil" terrain. Unfortunately, the color values don't match that well, but if you play with them, you can get good results.

 Have fun
