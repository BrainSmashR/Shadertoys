HappyBouncing.fuse
===========

Based on '_[happy bouncing](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/flyXRh)_' by [leon](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/leon) and ported by [JiPi ](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

A new conversion method is used here. nmbr73 has developed a Python script and an incubator fuse, which enables shaders to be converted much more effectively and conveniently. It's still in the middle of development, but it's already very powerful.
A total of 3 shader toys are combined in this shader fuse:
