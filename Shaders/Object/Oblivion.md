Oblivion.fuse :space_invader:
===========

Based on '_[Oblivion](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtfXDN)_' by [Dave_Hoskins](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Dave_Hoskins) and ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

The drone from the science fiction film Oblivion. There are 5 scenes available that can be played back individually. With the Image1, the drone's red eye can be brought to life. With Image2 the floor can be changed, with Image3 the floor and the reflective surface of the drone and with Image 4 the sky.

Have fun playing
