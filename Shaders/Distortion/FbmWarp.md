# FbmWarp

This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[Fbm Warp](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ttGyzG)_' by [hanker](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/hanker). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [Distortion](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

This shader obviously takes advantage of a trick in WebGL that doesn't quite work that way in DCTL. A small adjustment made at least the principle function possible. If the result looks a little different, it is not worse.
