# DisplacementShader

This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[DisplacementShader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MtBfR3)_' by [Coolok](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Coolok). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [Distortion](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

Nothing special, but still a very nice effect. Possibly also useful for transitions.
