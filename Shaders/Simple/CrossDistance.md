# CrossDistance

This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[Cross - distance](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtGfzw)_' by [iq](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/iq). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [nmbr73](../../Site/Profiles/nmbr73.md). See [Simple](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

This was my very first attempt to play with Fuses and the conversion of WebGL to DCTL.
