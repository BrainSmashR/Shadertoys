This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[craziness](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wdjSRc)_' by [spsherk_](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/spsherk_). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [nmbr73](../../Site/Profiles/nmbr73.md). See [Simple](README.md) for more fuses in this category.
