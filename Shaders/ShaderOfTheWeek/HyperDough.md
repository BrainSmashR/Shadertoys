HyperDough.fuse
===========

Based on '_[HyperDough](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tcGWB)_' by [Tater](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Tater) and ported by [JiPi ](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

I have to admit this is not going to be my favorite shader. There are a few interesting points to be found, but the part with the blue noise was not accessible to me. But it is a funny structure that can be viewed from all sides.

Have fun playing
