TasteOfNoise7.fuse
===========

Based on '_[Taste Of Noise 7](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NddSWs)_' by [leon](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/leon) and ported by [JiPi ](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

A very nice abstract shader that gets by with only one buffer. I have also added the option of using a texture in this fuse. This can be adjusted using the "Contrast" parameter. You can also play with the parameters AStart, Falloff, Count and Repetition.

Have fun playing
