# TasteOfNoise7

This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[Taste Of Noise 7](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NddSWs)_' by [leon](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/leon). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [ShaderOfTheWeek](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

A very nice abstract shader that gets by with only one buffer. I have also added the option of using a texture in this fuse. This can be adjusted using the "Contrast" parameter. You can also play with the parameters AStart, Falloff, Count and Repetition.

Have fun playing
