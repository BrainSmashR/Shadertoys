# SimpleRefractionTest

This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[simple refraction test](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/flcSW2)_' by [drschizzo](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/drschizzo). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [ShaderOfTheWeek](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

A very nice shader with refraction, unfortunately the result can only be generated with Cuda. With OpenCL, compiling takes forever and only the cuboid appears as a result, the drops are only rendered rudimentarily.
