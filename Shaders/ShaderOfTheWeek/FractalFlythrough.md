This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[FractalFlythrough](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4s3SRN)_' by [Shane](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Shane). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [ShaderOfTheWeek](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

Again a great shader of Shane. You can select three materials. In the original, these are each applied to parts of the walls. Without input image, the color can be selected.

Have fun
