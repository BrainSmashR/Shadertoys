FractalFlythrough.fuse
===========

Based on '_[Fractal Flythrough](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wsKXDV)_' by [shane](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/shane) and ported by [JiPi ](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

Again a great shader of Shane. You can select three materials. In the original, these are each applied to parts of the walls. Without input image, the color can be selected.

Have fun
