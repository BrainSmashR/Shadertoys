AlexanderHornedSphereZoom.fuse
===========

Based on '_[AlexanderHornedSphereZoom](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ttyGzW)_' by [tmst](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/tmst) and ported by [JiPi ](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

An interesting implementation of a mathematically pathological structure. A sphere embedded in space with an infinitely fine, recursively generated object structure.
In the implementation, both mat3 and mat4 matrices are used extensively.

Have fun playing
