# AlexanderHornedSphereZoom

This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[Alexander horned sphere zoom](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ttyGzW)_' by [tmst](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/tmst). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [ShaderOfTheWeek](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

<!-- +++ DO NOT REMOVE THIS COMMENT +++ DO NOT ADD OR EDIT ANY TEXT BEFORE THIS LINE +++ IT WOULD BE A REALLY BAD IDEA +++ -->

An interesting implementation of a mathematically pathological structure. A sphere embedded in space with an infinitely fine, recursively generated object structure.
In the implementation, both mat3 and mat4 matrices are used extensively.

Have fun playing
