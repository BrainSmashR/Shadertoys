Based on '_[Undulating Columns](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WlXXDH)_' by [fizzer](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/fizzer) and ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

A simple but beautiful shader. A cubemap can be connected to Image1-Input and thus a three-dimensional illumination can be achieved. A noise pattern can be applied to Image2-Input, but this has hardly any influence on the shader.

Have fun playing
