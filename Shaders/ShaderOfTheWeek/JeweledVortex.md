Based on '_[Jeweled Vortex](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fdjfDc)_' by [ChunderFPV](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/ChunderFPV) and ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

A nice little compact shader. The type of spirals can be changed with the iMouse parameter. A digital display shows the spiral value, but this can also be hidden. There are also parameters for coloring.

Have fun playing
