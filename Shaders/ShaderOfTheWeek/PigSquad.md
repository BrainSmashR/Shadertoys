Based on '_[Pig Squad](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WdBcRh)_' by [bpfarrell](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/bpfarrell) and ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

A very cute shader that is now celebrating its nine year anniversary.
I added parameters for all part colors. Color1's alpha controls the pig and block, and Color3's alpha controls background transparency.
