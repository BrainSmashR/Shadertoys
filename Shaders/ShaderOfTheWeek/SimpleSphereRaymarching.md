This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[SimpleSphereRaymarching](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wdjSRc)_' by [drschizzo](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/drschizzo). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [ShaderOfTheWeek](README.md) for more fuses in this category.
