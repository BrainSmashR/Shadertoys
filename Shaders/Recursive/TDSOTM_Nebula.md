# TDSOTM_Nebula

This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[The dark side of the moon](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dBSDV)_' by [bytewave](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/bytewave). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [Recursive](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

As a Pink Floyd fan, I couldn't resist turning the toy into a fuse.
