# LearningReactionDiffusion

This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[LearningReactionDiffusion](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WlSGzy)_' by [TekF](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/TekF). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [Recursive](README.md) for more fuses in this category.
