# Dynamism

This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[Dynamism](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MtKSWW)_' by [nimitz](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/nimitz). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [Abstract](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

Accidentally came across this beautiful shader while browsing older WSL posts. At the time, it seemed too complicated to convert. With the current knowledge, however, it went quickly. The bokeh effect can be changed using the draw parameter, otherwise there are no parameters.


Have fun playing
