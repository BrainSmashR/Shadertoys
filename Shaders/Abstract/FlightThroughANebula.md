This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[Flight Through A Nebula V3](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsK3Rd)_' by [morgan3d](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/morgan3d). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [Abstract](README.md) for more fuses in this category.
