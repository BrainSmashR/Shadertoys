This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[Rainbow Slices](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdsGD4)_' by [fizzer](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/fizzer). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [nmbr73](../../Site/Profiles/nmbr73.md). See [Abstract](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

This is a quick and dirty convesion that will definiely need some rework. But it turned out to be very easy to tranlate so far and as this version already runs on Metal I wanted to share the itermediate result.
