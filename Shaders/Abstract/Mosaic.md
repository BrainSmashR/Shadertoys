# Mosaic

This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[voronoi solid with borders](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtySRc)_' by [Darksecond](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Darksecond). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [Abstract](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

Mosaics have always fascinated me. I know there are very good standard tools out there that are probably better than this shader, but the conversion still appealed to me.
In addition to the mosaic size and the joint width, the joint color can also be changed.

Have fun playing
