This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[Fractal Land](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsBXWt)_' by [Kali](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Kali). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [nmbr73](../../Site/Profiles/nmbr73.md). See [Misc](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

In the meantime this Fuse's output is pretty close to the original Shader and it also runs on Win/Mac, Metal/OpenCL/Cuda now.

Still some work left to be done:
- investigate if and how to really substitute `texture` and `textureLod` function calls
- add parameters for `WAVE`, other aspects already outlined in the original shader code, and maybe for some color adjustments
- get this :cat: into the Fuse
