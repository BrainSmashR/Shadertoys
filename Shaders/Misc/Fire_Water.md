# Fire_Water

This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[ComplementaryElements](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tdsBz4)_' by [izutionix](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/izutionix). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [Misc](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

Two tailed comets "Fire" and "Water" circle around each other

[![Fire_Water](Fire_Water.png)](Fire_Water.fuse)

This fuse actually contains two shadertoys (in addition to the specified one: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3sfBzM)
There are extensive parameters available. This fuse is also generated by a recursively called DCTL code. This means that the result cannot be reproduced in the event of an interruption and should be generated with a Saver or SavetoDisk (and Lock). In addition, it must be ensured that the color resolution should be at least float16, otherwise gray fog will result.
Due to the recursive call, the picture is changed when parameters are adjusted, even in Stop, but since the frame number does not change, the result is incorrect. This must be taken into account with all recursive shaders.
When switching on the manual mode, the CrosshairControl of the center is hidden in order not to disturb the CrosshairControl of the manual position, but it can also be switched on if necessary (OnScreenWidgets).
The parameters invite you to play.

Here is a little study of this fuse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R7ZVMyKLnY


Have fun
