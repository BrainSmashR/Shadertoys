This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[FunWithMetaballs](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MlyXWV)_' by [fwilliams](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/fwilliams). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [Blob](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

This Shader has four Blobs, three Lights, Ambientlight and Background. All colors can be changed, the size of the blobs and their fading, too. I hope enough opportunities to play.
