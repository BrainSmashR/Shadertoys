This Fuse is based on the Shadertoy '_[FractalRadioBase](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WlcczS)_' by [gaz](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/gaz). Conversion to DCTL and encapsulation into a fuse done by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md). See [Fractals](README.md) for more fuses in this category.

An alien antenna hovers through the universe. So far only a few parameters are available.
In the original, very nice details were added via BufferA, but this has been omitted here in the conversion.
