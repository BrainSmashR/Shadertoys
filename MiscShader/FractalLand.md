Fractal Land
============

Based on '_[Fractal Land](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsBXWt)_' by [Kali](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Kali) and ported by [nmbr73](../Profiles/nmbr73.md). This Shader does still not render as I would expect it (put it's pretty close) - therefore I did not yet spent time on compability (currently it only compiles and runs on macOS Metal).
