SimpleSphereRaymarching.fuse
===========

Based on '_[SimpleSphereRaymarching](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NdKGWV)_' by [drschizzo](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/drschizzo) and ported by [JiPi ](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

A nice shader in which the dFdx / dFdy functions from Shadertoy were used again for the HeightMap. This time I found a replacement solution for this.

Have fun playing
