===========

Based on '_[20210930_CLUB-CAVE-09](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ss3SD8)_' by [0b5vr](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/0b5vr) and ported by [JiPi ](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

An abstract shader, with an interesting approach to generating random numbers. The image input is intended for a noise texture.

Have fun playing
