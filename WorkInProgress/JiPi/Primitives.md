Raymarching Primitives Commented
==================

Based on '_[Raymarching Primitives Commented](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ltyXD3)_' by [huttarl](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/huttarl) and ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

A very nice exercise shader to explore the raymarching principle. The shader is well commented and you can play in it very nicely.
