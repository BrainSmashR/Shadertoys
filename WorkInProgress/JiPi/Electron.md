Electron
==================

Based on '_[Electron](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MslGRn)_' by [gopher](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/gopher) and ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

Cool effect, with interesting code. Amplitude, frequency and strength could be used as parameters for animation.
