Ekranoplan
==================

Based on '_[Ekranoplan](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Wd3fDH)_' by [dr2](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/dr2) and ported by ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

I would also like to have it as a private jet :-) A small mistake in one of the "q.xz" adjustments made me curse a bit. In any case, the shader invites you to develop further: fly curves, shoot missiles, apply textures.
