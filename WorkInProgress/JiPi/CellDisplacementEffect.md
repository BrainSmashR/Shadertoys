==================

Based on '_[Cell Displacement Effect](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsl3Rs)_' by [jaszunio15](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/jaszunio15) and ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

An image is broken up into small pieces that gradually enlarge. A very nice and, above all, very easy to implement effect that is very suitable for transitions.
