Milk Ocean
==================

Based on '_[Milk Ocean](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fll3RN)_' by [ssartell](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/ssartell) and ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

Drops fall into the liquid in slow motion and create waves. A very compact shader that still has great lighting and animation.
