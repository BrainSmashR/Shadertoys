Fire Reaction
==================

Based on '_[Fire Reaction](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wtSGRc)_' by [wyatt](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/wyatt) and ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

One of the greatest shaders in the reaction diffusion shader series. There are four different "chemicals": fuel, oxygen, flame and nothing (i.e. carbon dioxide) With the draw parameter you can now "light" the fuel, it only burns when there is a fuel-oxygen mixture, but this is caused by diffusion . A totally cool shader to play with.
