Continuum Mechanics II
==================

Based on '_[Continuum Mechanics II](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tdVcWR)_' by [wyatt](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/wyatt) and ported by [JiPi](../../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

A great shader that does two different ways to deform a texture. On the one hand a wave simulation in which the texture is apparently under water and on the other hand a liquid simulation in which the texture liquefies itself.
However, there are situations in which calculation errors occur. The attempt to intercept the NaN results only partially worked.
