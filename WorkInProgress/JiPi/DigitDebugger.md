DigitDebugger
==================

Based on '_[DigitDebugger](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tdcBDN)_' by [rito15](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/rito15) and porting by [JiPi](Profiles/JiPi.md).


I had already found a way to display values in the shader. This has the advantage that the integration is easier, but there are not so many parameters.
